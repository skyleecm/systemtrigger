systemtrigger
=============

System Trigger is a very simple Android tool.

Currently, it does only 2 things:

1. it can run/execute a command, and launch another Android app when the device boots up.
2. it can run/execute a command when the device shutdowns or reboots.

----

In version 0.20, the tool adds reboot and reboot to recovery buttons. (Both are enabled only if the device is rooted)

The code now depends on [libsuperuser](https://github.com/Chainfire/libsuperuser).
